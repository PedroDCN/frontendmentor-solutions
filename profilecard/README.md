## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

An easy challenge, the hardest part was thinking about how I should center the profile image to align with the background,
I decided to translate it up by half its size, so that it was aligned with the image while maintaining the document layout.

### Continued development

Need to find a better way to manage the placement of multiple background images.
