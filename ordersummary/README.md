## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm still practicing using BEM naming convention, and this was a good project to try using it by my own, without help.
Still a little confused about how I should name buttons that are supposed to look like links but aren't,
and if the way I styled my different types of buttons using modifiers was correct, or if there is a better way, maybe I'll try and redo this project, but with a different approach, like using CUBE CSS methodology, where
an exception (element modifier) would be specified as a data attribute rather than another class.

This was a good exercise to practice defining the position and flow of elements using flexbox,
where I learned to use `flex: auto` and `flex: none` properties.

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with the way I'm applying BEM, need more time researching and studying a better way of naming,
and maybe find a good balance of BEM and utility classes.
